• Challenging Vorago will open a chat prompt for all players located in the starting area, asking to join the fight

• The entry hit is split between all players that joined the challenge, capped at 12,500 each player (14,000 in Hard Mode), i.g. challenging in Normal Mode with 5 players, everyone will take 10,000 damage

.modes
> **__Modes__** 

Vorago offers two different modes: **Normal Mode / NM** $blue and **Hard Mode / HM** $red . The differences between Normal Mode to Hard Mode are explained in #mechanics.

Hard Mode can only be started by creating an instance from the borehole entrance after having mauled $maul all rotations in NM - Joining a friend does not share this requirement. In HM, there are no message box or chat warnings for mechanics such as Red Bombs $red , Reflects $link and Green Bombs $Green .

In both difficulties (NM & HM) the strategies for how to deal with mechanics does not vary a lot between team sizes. Bomb and Base Tank have to take care of their designated responsibilities. Generally speaking, any size greater than duo simply adds a free DPS to the team.

__Normal Mode:__

• 4man+ <#744505609696837726> Any person other than the Base Tank, Bomb Tank and TL5 are free DPS
• Trio Normal Mode <#753663290718158898> Roles are split into Base Tank, Bomb Tank and TL5
• Duo Normal Mode <#742616349658054656> Base Tank does not vary and the Bomb Tank takes over the TL5's responsibilities

__Hard Mode:__

• Trio Hard Mode <#802162163686572082> In-depth breakdown of everything Trio HM (strategies for roles in 4man+ HM vary insignificantly)
• Duo Hard Mode <#714808600123408384> The Base Tank is simultaneously the Bomb Tank #2
