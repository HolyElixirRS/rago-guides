> __**Guide Writing**__

Before you dive into Rago Hub guide writing, you should take a couple of minutes for understanding the syntax that our <@&812409511179845663> Discord bot uses to parse guides into proper styling.

__Character Limit:__

Due to Discord messages having a limit of `2000` characters, Rago Hub guides need to be sent in multiple messages. To achieve an intentional separation of content into respective messages, this is simply achieved by adding a dot `.` to the start of a line. This dot will tell the Discord bot to send the current message and start parsing a new section.

.
__Indices:__

Indexing is a very important aspect of writing large guides. The Discord bot automatically links messages by following a specific syntax. Messages are linked by assigning section identifiers to messages. This identifier is added to the start of a message, appended to the content separator `.`. The message ID can be retrieved and linked by this short syntax: `{link:id}`, with the `id` representing the section identifier you assigned earlier. Furthermore, you can tell the Discord bot to automatically pin indices. Do so by assigning the Index message the section identifier `index`.

• `.` Write a new message

.guidestyling

> __**Guide Styling**__

• Avoid using contractions such as "isn't", rather use "is not" (formal writing)
• Format damage numbers with in-line code blocks, i.e. `10,000`, `4,000`, `10,667`
• If possible, follow proper capitalisation in English grammar: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_in_English>
• Use british over american spelling, i.e. "colour" instead of "color"
• Section headlines: `> __**Headline**__`, one preceding and one trailing blank line
• Sub-headlines: `__Sub-Headline:__`, one preceding and one trailing blank line
• Listing: `• Item of a big list`, one blank line before the first and one after the last item
• Images should be labeled as list items without colons or other formatting

.emojilist
> __**Emoji List**__

The emoji syntax is parsed by adding the character dollar `$` preceding to emoji keywords. For example, writing `$flush` will be converted to :flushed:. A full list of Emojis can be found in #emojis.

.testing
> __**Testing**__

Head to our <#812595920935321632> channel and use the command `/txtpost` either with an attached text file or with the content added within the Discord message.
