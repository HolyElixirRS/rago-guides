Ability Rotations
Ability damage rotations are from now on outsourced from the Rago Hub Discord. They can all be found on the official Rago Hub spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg

The Rago Hub spreadsheet features 150+ unique ability damage rotations that we constantly maintain and update depending on the powercreep and other game updates.
All rotations have been exported with Sheety (refer to #affiliates) to provide you all the best experience possible for learning new rotation sets for your Vorago journey.

Shoutouts to Celly, Saif, XTL, Die Alive, Sly for contributing to the spreadsheet ability damage rotation collection! (placeholder, will use pings when posted)
