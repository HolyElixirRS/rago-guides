> __**Duo Hard Mode**__

This guide focuses on Duo Hard Mode Vorago only. If you're looking for the Duo Normal Mode guide, check out <#744505794682290217>. The most important and most difficult part about duo hard mode is that Vorago always fires 2 blue bombs at once, if two persons are in reach. To understand how to avoid a second blue bomb being launched, read through <#718435693432406157>. Up to P10 and P11, this is mostly handled with devo / cade cepting.

.
__Requirements:__

• Knowledge how to Devotion / Barricade Intercept $devo $cade $cept - Reference: <#744505436685991986>
• Ingenuity of the Humans $ingen
• Statius's Warhammer $swh
• Seren Godbow $sgb (to effectively use SGB in Duo HM as mage, refer to <#718431678086774925>)

.
__Recommendations:__

• **Important:** Knowledge how to <#731487797336211507> $tc
• Knowledge about stalling Vorago in phases 10 / 11 - Refererence: <#734513733883396146>
• Knowledge about <#718435693432406157> to avoid Blue Bombs $blue
• Limitless $limitless
• Malletops for extended Barricade $cade
• 2 dummies each player $dummy for phases 2, 4, 9 and 11
• Nihil $nihil (do not use ice nihil)

.
__Nihil vs. Pack Yak / Mammoth:__

Generally speaking, if you are only trying to go for a kill and do not want to bother with doing phases 1 - 9 in an optimal way, using a Pack Yak $yak or Mammoth $mammoth is going to lead you to a successful duo hardmode kill faster. Yet, using a Nihil will significantly decrease the supply upkeep cost throughout your attempts. Therefore it is recommended to learn the mechanics and strategies properly.

.
__Ability Rotations:__

Rago Hub maintains a spreadsheet with over 150+ unique ability rotations. Whilst the provided Duo Hard Mode ability rotations are aimed towards advanced and experienced Ragoers, it is still recommended to check them out. You can easily adjust the rotations to your personal preferences.

> __**Phase 1**__

In phase 1, Blue Bombs $blue have a drastic chance of *dragging* the Bomb Tank from his climb. To prevent this from happening, the Base Tank has to keep Vorago far enough on the eastern wall, so that no blues are launched at the climber. Only once they reached the final platform from which they can voke $voke, the Base Tank lures Vorago closer to the west.

.
__Base tank:__

Stall Vorago and delay the first Red Bomb $red until shortly before the Bomb Tank can voke $voke. The goal with stalling the Red Bomb launch that long is to avoid one being launched early during jump. If done correctly, the second Red Bomb will be fired *after* the Bomb Tank has jumped.

• Disrupt $disrupt and Excalibur $excal as you drop into Phase 1
• Starting point is the white rectangle, MD east of Vorago
• Use thresholds until your bomb tank jumps
• Apply SWH $swh in TC
• Bladed dive $bd to the south east corner
• At your 3rd - 4th ability after TC, as Vorago does his first auto attack, start walking to the north east corner, along the eastern wall
• If done correctly, Vorago is not going to auto you at all while walking north, so you have long soul split uptime
• At the north eastern corner, pray flick until the Red Bomb $red is launched (utilise Devotion $devo if necessary)
• Bladed dive $bd to the west before the non-homing Blue Bomb $blue hits you, so that the Bomb Tank can voke Vorago
• South-voke $voke Vorago ASAP
• As the Bomb Tank jumps, escape $escape and bladed dive $bd to the southern wall, then walk back to the north and keep building to 100% with defensives
• Ideally Vorago switches aggro to the Bomb Tank, if not, keep pray flicking
*Note: Vorago does a slight turn-around of ~ 45° clock-wise if he switches aggro.*
.
• You can see Blue Bombs $blue being fired by watching Vorago's animation during the jump
• If Vorago switches to the Bomb Tank during jump, voke $voke after, to allow your Bomb Tank to step under
• If Vorago stays on the Base Tank, step under and Heal Other $heal / Devotion Intercept $devo $cept
• After jump, use Metamorphosis $metamorphosis

.

__Bomb tank:__

• Do a normal climb - Reference: <#744505344088080434>
• Once you have reached the final platform, voke $voke Vorago
• Use SGB $sgb, thresholds and a couple of basics
• Jump 1 - 2 ticks before the first Blue Bomb $blue hits
• If Vorago switches to you during your jump, Devotion Intercept $devo $cept the Base Tank afterwards (alternatively: step under and Heal Other $heal)
• If Vorago stays on the Base Tank during your jump, voke $voke afterwards and step away, to allow the Base Tank for stepping under

> __**Phase 2**__

Both players should utilise Guthix Staff $gstaff and Storm Shards $shard throughout the phase. Your goal should be to always apply 10 shards by Bring Him Down.

__Base tank:__

• Bladed dive $bd back under Vorago after escaping $escape the second bleed $bleed, to avoid the launched Blue Bomb $blue
• Red bombs 1 and 3 cade cept $cade $cept
• Devotion $devo before second and last reflect $ragoreflect to prevent eating during Bring Him Down

__Bomb Tank:__

• Cade cept $cade $cept the second Red Bomb $red
• Tag all gravity fields $gravity

__Bring Him Down:__

• $ranged Ranged: $sgb > $snipe > $grico
• $magic Mage: $barrage $wm > $dbreath > $barrage $asphyx

If both players use magic, Shatter $shatter should be utilised for consistently passing the damage check.
