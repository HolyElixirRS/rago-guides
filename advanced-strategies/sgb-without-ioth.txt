> __**SGB without IOTH**__

This quick guide’s purpose is to explain how to effectively make use of the Seren Godbow $sgb without wasting the Ingenuity of the Humans $ingen.
Having 7 or more affinity stacks applied to Vorago (Statius's Warhammer  $swh with Guthix Staff $gstaff or Quake $quake) will better, but isn’t necessary for the method.

__Execution:__

• Unequip your armour chest, legs and head
• Unequipping your head slot is optional, but highly recommended
• Activate Desolation $desolation
• Use the Seren Godbow special attack $sgb

The exact same principle can be used to reapply SWH (use Malevolence $malevolence instead) during **P5 NM and 10/11 HM!**, but can be used on any other phase for the same purpose.

> __**Useful Example Scenarios**__

• The End special attack in the first quadrant
• Normal mode P5 / Hard Mode P10 and P11
