__Luring:__

Solo luring Phase 1 itself is fairly straight forward: Simply follow the exact tiles marked on the image in the correct order and you will have solo lured Phase 1. The difficult part is combining the Solo Lure with a perfect DPS rotation $zerk, pray flicking $deflectmelee $deflectmagic (deflect magic if you happen to get a Blue Bomb $blue) and vuln bombing $vbomb.

> __**Hard Mode**__

In Hard Mode Phase 1 all Blue Bombs $blue have a drastic chance of dragging the climber. Therefore, Vorago must be lured to the east rather than west in order to not cause a climb's failure. Solo luring from the east is a tad easier than performing the Normal Mode lure from the west. The Hard Mode Solo Lure consists of a simple execution of surges $surge in order to place Vorago in spot consistently, completely independent of his walking direction.

• Position in melee distance east of Vorago's spawn at `#1`
• Move to either tile of `#2`
• Surge $surge in Target Cycle $tc and Provoke $voke one tick after
• Remain at tile `#3` until the timer hits 26 - 27 seconds (or later if your climber is slow)
• Move to `#4`, one step to the west and Surge $surge
• Remain at `#5` for 4 ticks until Vorago reached jump spot
• Bladed Dive $bd to `#6`, in melee distance south of Vorago
