> __**Stepping Under (Hard Mode)**__

This guide explains the phenomenon of Blue Bombs $blue not being fired at you if **stepping under** Vorago. This strategy is useful in Duo and Trio Hard Mode. Video example for Duo Hard Mode Green Bomb Phase 6: https://discordapp.com/channels/670983760178839572/715355791544287255/720322047678480464

• This is only applicable to the person that Vorago does **not** hold his current aggro
• Melee Swipes $swipe will still hit you if the Base Tank stays in melee distance
• Stepping under does **not** prevent random Red Bombs $red

__Execution:__

• Simply clicking the ground once after each offensive ability you do
• It is recommended to step under with a slightly shifted camera angle from Vorago's backside, respectively the opposite side of the Base Tank
• Commonly the person voking $voke positions either at the side of the L-Rock or to the north of Vorago
• Channeled abilities (i.e.: Asphyxiate $asphyx) do not force your character to move back out
• Flanking can be perfectly utilised while stepping under
