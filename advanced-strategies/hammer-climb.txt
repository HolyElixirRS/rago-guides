Standard climbs for P1: #climbing

Hammer climbing is the use of cycle target $tc to attack Vorago before starting your climb in phase 1 without losing any ticks in the process. The goals when hammer climbing are:

• Force the first red bomb $red that is launched upon target cycling on the climber (yourself)
• Apply SWH $swh to Vorago to save your base tank the adrenaline they'd have needed for applying it themselves
• Do not lose any ticks

.tips
> __**Tips**__

• The target cycle $tc tick (refer to: #target-cycle) in phase 1 is at `9.0 - 9.6` seconds
• The starting red bomb $red is launched in the second tick at `9.6 - 10.2` seconds
• Climbing an obstacle nullifies any damage dealt
