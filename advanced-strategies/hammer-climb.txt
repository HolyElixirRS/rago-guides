> __**Hammer Climb**__

• Phase 1 standard and acceleration $accel climb: #climbing

Hammer Climbing describes the use of Target Cycle $tc to attack Vorago before starting your climb in Phase 1 without losing any ticks in the process.

• Force the first Red Bomb $red that is launched upon target cycling on the climber (yourself)
• Apply SWH $swh on Vorago to save your Base Tank the adrenaline they would have needed for hammering themselves
• Do not lose any ticks

.Tips
> __**Tips**__

• The Target Cycle $tc tick (reference: #target-cycle) in Phase 1 is at `9.0` - `9.6` seconds
• The starting red bomb $red is launched in the second tick at `9.6` - `10.2` seconds
• Climbing an obstacle nullifies any damage dealt
