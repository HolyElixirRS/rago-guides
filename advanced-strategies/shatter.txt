> __**Shatter**__

After unlocking the Storm Shards & Shatter abilities $shard $shatter from the Mazcab ability codex, it is a commonly used strategy to apply as many storm shards $shard as possible during Phase 2 and 4 to then use Shatter $shatter as you passed Bring Him Down or after the third waterfall $waterfall to trigger all stacked shards and kill Vorago in the first possible tick.
 
.
> __**Bring Him Down example rotations**__
Using Shatter as a slow hitting ability ($ranged without fast hitting overrides or $magic from 5+ tiles) will allow you to Shatter 1 tick earlier.
BHD has a duration, counting from the first GCD of the damage check, of 20 ticks / 12 seconds in **Normal Mode** and 13 ticks / 7.8 seconds in **Hard Mode**. Example rotations:
