This guide is about soloing P5 as a full kill is not yet doable, because of P1 mechanically requiring 2 people. Soloing P5 Vorago is an impressive achievement once thought of to be impossible. A large portion of the reason how it was eventually completed is due to the discovery of stacking 3 attacks in a tick. The reason this is so impactful is because Vorago is only allowed to move once per tick, and any more than 1 square of pushback is nulled. Stacking attacks has a chance of blocking 2 squares of pushback with a melee hit or only 1 square of pushback if you get a bomb as the third hit. This is a lot better than tanking the 3 attacks in each of the individual ticks.

.Stacking Auto Attacks
> __**Stacking Auto Attacks**__

The discovery of stacking 3 auto attacks in 1 tick plays a primary part in achieving a solo Vorago phase 5. Vorago $vorago is allowed to move only once per tick - Any more than 1 square is nulled. Stacking autos always blocks 1 square of push-back with the chance of blocking another.

• Stacking two blue bombs $blue to deal damage in the same tick blocks one square of push backwards
• Receiving a melee swipe $swipe as the third auto results in another blocked square

Stacking 3 of Vorago’s auto attacks in 1 tick requires you to first take a *Far Bomb* followed by a *Close Bomb* and lastly a *Melee Swipe*. Do not deal damage during this process: Vorago **must not be stalled** during his 3 consecutive auto attacks!

__Far Bomb:__

• Distance: 9 - 10 squares
• Travel time: 6 ticks

__Close Bomb:__

• Distance: 0 - 2 squares (it is highly discouraged to be in MD due to the chance of receiving a melee swipe)
• Travel time: 3 ticks

Bringing a Spirit Shield $elysian will help to reduce the damage you take from multiple auto attacks in 1 tick. You should pray magic $deflectmagic and use either Resonance $resonance or Shield Dome $dome to help mitigate the damage. Only equip the shield for stacking autos and recover prayer drain immediately.

.Setup
> __**Setup**__

__Invention Perks:__

• Crackling $crackling and Aftershock $aftershock are highly discouraged due to unintentional push-back and stall during Reflect $link or while stacking 3 auto attacks
• Energising $energizing is significantly useful for adrenaline management

__Archaeology Relics:__

• Fury Of The Small $fots - Reference: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Fury_of_the_Small>
• Heightened Senses $heightenedsenses - Reference: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Heightened_Senses>

The latter relic is significantly important to allow the general ability rotation:  $reprisal > $anticipation > $sgb > $snipe > $cshot > $gdazing > $cade

__Preset:__

• The Ring Of Vigour $vigour must be used for all Ultimates and Special Attacks
• A Spirit Shield $elysian of any kind (excluding spectral)

.Clearing Bleeds
> __**Clearing Bleeds**__

Clearing Bleeds $bleed in a solo phase 5 optimally requires the Double Escape Codex $doubleescape to be unlocked.

• Escape $escape for the first Bleed
• Run back closer to Vorago and Freedom $freedom the second Bleed
• Ideally you should apply SWH $ingen $swh after Freedom
• Escape again for the third Bleed
• Stay in 9 - 10 squares distance to prepare for stacking the following 3 auto attacks

.Push
> __**Push**__

Soloing requires you to outlast Vorago's pushback. His melee swipe $swipe / blue bomb $blue each deal a maximum of 1 square push backwards. To push 1 square forwards `20,000` damage is required to be dealt. This means that one of Vorago's attacks equates to about ~ 20k of the player's damage that they will have to make up for. Damage dealt beyond the required damage for a push in the same tick adds to the overflow. A detailed explanation of the overflow mechanic can be read in #zero-linking.

Due to walking limitations, Vorago can push a maximum of 1 square per tick. Taking multiple auto attacks in one tick or dealing enough damage to push 2 squares forwards within one tick will result in lost push, causing only 1 square of push.

• Debilitate $debil should never be used
• Shield Dome $dome should only be used for reducing the damage taken from 3 auto attacks in one tick

__Disruption Shield:__

Disruption Shield $disrupt does not work reliably for all blue bombs that you receive. The only blue bomb $blue that is guaranteed to be blocked by *disrupt* is the **first** auto attack. Due to this, disruption shield should only be used if the third auto attack happens to be a blue bomb instead of a melee swipe (and hope for it to work).

Example of Disruption Shield not blocking a blue bomb:

.

__Increased Chance For Melee swipes:__

There is an increased chance for a melee swipe $swipe if you stand in melee distance after a forced blue bomb $bluebomb (not standing MD for an auto). For Reflects $link with Barricade $cade this should be used to your advantage by not standing MD for the first two autos after Reflect. This strategy can be applied to all team sizes.

Stepping MD after a forced blue bomb:

.Ability Damage Rotations
> __**Ability Damage Rotations**__

$tc $snap > $ts $preparation > $reprisal > $anticipation $vbomb

$sgb > $snipe > $cshot: > $gdazing > $cade > **Reflect** $link

Use Piercing Shot $piercing twice during Reflect with the Energising $energizing Perk

Clear Bleeds $bleed with $escape > $freedom > $ingen $swh $escape > $apot

Distance 9 - 10 squares from MD and Death's Swiftness $swiftness

Stack 3 Auto Attacks
.
$ts $preparation > $anticipation > $vbomb > $sgb > $snipe: > $snap

Position 9 - 10 squares from MD

Stack 3 Auto Attacks > **Reflect** $link

Stack 3 Auto Attacks > Clear Bleeds $bleed with $escape > $freedom > $shadowtendrils $escape > $snap

Stack 3 Auto Attacks

$ts $preparation > $reprisal > $anticipation > $sgb > $snipe > $cshot > $gdazing > $cade

Ideally you are 2 squares off Maul $maul at this point. If not, repeat the same procedure until you are 2 squares off Maul. Once you are 2 off Maul after a Barricade $cade finish the kill:

$cshot > $fragmentation > $shadowtendrils > $snap > $sgb > $gbarge $maul

.Miscellaneous Information
> __**Miscellaneous Information**__

• Equip Onyx Bakriminel Bolts $onyxbolts after Vorago reaches `70,000` HP
• If your SGB $sgb pushes on the first arrow (3rd tick), you have the potential of losing some arrows (4th tick) because Vorago is not in the same spot as when the SGB was cast
• Occasionally a bug applies to the same scenario where you lose all overflow you would have from arrows 2 - 5 (reference: #zero-linking)
• Pushing twice with SGB also results in potentially stalling your Snap Shot $snap after Snipe $snipe in a Death's Swiftness $swiftness
• After stalling Snap Shot, do not use abilities other than Bladed Dive $bd (to stack 3 auto attacks) and Shield Dome $dome (to mitigate damage from stacked autos), then **CLICK** on Vorago or vuln $vuln to release your Snap Shot before doing any other damaging ability
