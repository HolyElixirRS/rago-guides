> __**Trio Normal Mode**__

The Top Lure Voke 5 (TL5) is the primary focus of this guide. The responsibilities of the TL5 are to climb in Phase 1 (reference: #climbing) and lure Vorago him into jump spot, and to take the 5th Bleed $bleed with provoke $voke on every Bleed set throughout Phase 2 to 4 (reference: #clearing-bleeds). The TL5 always positions farther away from Vorago than the Base Tank and closer than the Bomb Tank (3-4 steps away).  If a Phase, Rotation or role is not mentioned on any Phase, it is because their jobs do not differ from higher team sizes and the TL5 does not have a specific job other than dpsing.

This guide focuses on Trio Normal Mode Vorago only and will not explain the basics of Vorago, for those go to #mechanics and #phase-overview. The guide is split into three roles: Base Tank, Bomb Tank and TL5. For the full strategies on Base Tank and Bomb Tank check #duo.

.Phase 1
> __**Phase 1**__

$maulpiecea Climbing reference: #climbing.

The only difference between Phase 1 in Trios compared to 4 man teams is that the TL5 will receive the Bombs $blue during the climb. This is to allow the Bomb Tank to focus on damage. Bombs $blue are forced on the TL5 when the Base Tank places Vorago West.

• Use Excalibur $excal on dropdown and Vitality $vitality if you are not doing the Acceleration climb $accel
• Eat to `8,000` HP since you’re getting Blues $blue
• The faster you are, the less damage you will take
• In Trios you should jump under `50,000` HP or right away if there is a Melee Base Tank
• If you need to drop the piece because you need the inventory space, do not do it until Phase 2 starts

.Phase 2
> __**Phase 2**__

• Provoke $voke after every 4th Bleed $bleed to take 5th one (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Activate all Gravity Fields so Base Tank and Bomb can focus on the other mechanics 
• If you are in charge of dummying $dummy Phase 2, drop it before BHD finishes
• The second maul piece (b) $maulpieceb will appear on the ground after passing BHD (reference: #maul)
• Kill Vorago and welcome to phase 3

.Phase 4
> __**Phase 4**__

• Step into Waterfalls :waterfall: and leave them as soon as possible by spam-clicking an ability 
• Position close enough to Vorago to not drag any Blue Bombs $blue
• If receiving a Stone Clone $vitalis, kill it
• Make sure to pick up at pieces as Phase 4 starts or as Phase 2 ends (reference: #maul)
• Provoke $voke after every 4th Bleed $bleed to take 5th one (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Off for Reflects $link
• At the end of Phase 4, it is the TL5’s job to pick up all the maul pieces and make the maul $maul before Phase 5 starts
• If you could not pick up the last piece in time, do it right away on Phase 5 so you can ultimate before Vorago appears

.Phase 5
> __**Phase 5**__

The Tl5 is expected to do the following for all Phase 5 regardless of the rotation.

• Same as the Base Tank except you are not switching with the BT, you stay as DPS for the whole Phase
• Having the maul $maul ready on dropdown and mauling in time (reference: #maul)
• If there is a Melee Base Tank you must do the Bomb Tank switch instead
• Let the Melee Base Tank maul $maul due to them being in melee distance for most of the Phase

.
> __**Weekly Specials (Rotations)**__

Every Wednesday at 00:00 GT (in-game reset), the weekly special rotation changes for Vorago. There are a total of 6 rotations: Ceilings $ceil, Scopulus $scop, Vitalis $vitalis, Green Bomb $green, Team Split $ts and The End $purple. These rotations will affect the mechanics in Phases 3, 4 and 5.

.Ceilings
> __**Ceiling Collapse**__

$ceil Ceilings reference: #ceilings
 
__Phase 3:__

This phase is FFA-Bomb Tank after Vorago jumps. Since you will be separated from the team, whoever is farther will become the Bomb Tank. This is done to avoid anyone from ditching their ultimates. Be prepared to take Bombs $blue if that happens.

• Pray Magic $deflectmage if receiving bombs
• Avoid rocks $ceil
• Use Thresholds at the start
• Off for Reflect $link
• Mid rocks should be destroyed (eat above `7,000` HP)
• Position close to Vorago after his second jump and Onslaught :Onslaught: (make use of your Adrenaline Potion to reach adrenaline for Onslaught), melee uses Berserk :Berserk:

__Phase 4:__

Destroy rocks according to HP management or if under the effect of cade cept $cept. Maul pieces $maulpiecea $maulpieceb may be stuck beneath rocks $ceil. Check your minimap to know where the piece is found if you can not find it. If after breaking the rock you still can not see it you have to move your camera up and they will appear. Otherwise wait until the next phase as they will be automatically dropped into Phase 5.

__Phase 5:__

Ceilings $ceil Phase 5 shares the same mechanics and strategies with #team-split $ts. For this reason, this same strategy will appear on the Team Split section below.

• Position in the South-East
• Once the Team Split :teamsplit: spawned, activate your Ultimate :Berserk: :DeathsSwiftness: :Sunshine: (if TCing: Pre-Ultimate before TS spawn - Reference: #target-cycle)
• After entering a TS, spam-click Vorago to automatically move back in the earliest that Vorago becomes attackable again and re-position yourself correctly in the South-East
• Position closer than the Bomb Tank to not receive any Blue Bombs :bluebomb~1: (the easiest approach for not dragging Blue Bombs is to tank the first Team Split explosion and stay in your Ultimate in the South-East)
• Reprisal :Reprisal: can be utilized perfectly for the 8,000 typeless hit from a Team Split explosion (need to pick Vorago as active target for Reprisal to deal damage)
• Off for Reflect :reflect:
• Clear Bleeds :Dismember: (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Repeat until Maul :maul~3:

.Scopulus
> __**Scopulus**__

.

__Phase 3:__

Ice Nihils $nihilice and Ripper Demons $ripper will cause Scopulii $scop to randomly change their target. Avoid using these familiars.

• Scopuli target those closest to them or those dealing the most damage to them
• Position at the marked green cross :negative_squared_cross_mark: and DD with the Base Tank
• Pray Melee :DeflectMelee:
• Provoke $voke immediately if a Scopulus walk is towards the Bomb
• To keep their aggression, throw vuln Bombs $vbomb at them
• Devotion $devo once the first Scopulus is about to die
• Prioritize AOE damage: :BloodBarrage: 4taa, :DragonBreath:, :Detonate:, :Cleave:, :Quake:, :Hurricane:, :GreaterFlurry:, :BladedDive:, :Bombardment:, :MechanisedChinchompa: 

__Phase 5:__

Scopulus $scop Phase 5 shares the same mechanics and strategies with #the-end $purple. For that reason, this same strategy will appear on the The End section below.

• Position in the South-East and pre-Ultimate :Berserk: :DeathsSwiftness: :Sunshine:
• Once your Purple Bomb timer hits 5 seconds (reference: #the-end), move to the North-East
• After your Purple Bomb exploded, move back South
• Off for Reflect :reflect:
• Clear Bleeds :Dismember: (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Repeat until Maul :maul~3:

.Vitalis
> __**Vitalis**__

$vitalis Vitalis reference: #vitalis

Bringing Dominion Mines $mines is highly recommended for Phases 4 and 5!

__Phase 3:__

• Everyone will pick a corner and be in melee distance
• You will receive both Melee swipes $swipe and Blue Bombs $blue during this Phase because everyone is MD
• You must prayer flick them in time $deflectmelee $deflectmagic
• During Reflect $link, equip an item via clicking in your inventory (this will make you stop attacking)
• You can also click under yourself to OFF if you are more experienced
• This Phase has Bleeds $bleed after the second cycle (if they happen, voke $voke the 5th one as usual)
• Do not move out of MD at any point during the Phase and __**never**__ go the Vitalis orb on Phase 3

.
__Phase 4:__

• Position yourself in the north-east quadrant (reference: #vitalis)
• Place Dominion Mines $mines at the correct location where the Vitalis orb is launched
• Step into the Vitalis orb explosion
• Prioritize killing all spawned Vitalii $vitalis right away

__Phase 5:__

As described in the mechanics channel for #vitalis, Vitalii $vitalis occasionally force your active target to switch back to Vorago. This can cause deadly PKs. Be careful your target stays on the Vitalis, and avoid using any AoE abilities if it’s close to Reflect $link.

• Place Dominion Mines close to MD as the Phase starts. Remember to place them again whenever they are off cooldown
• Position in the South-East and pre-Ultimate :Berserk: :DeathsSwiftness: :Sunshine:
• When the orb is released, step back, while following the South wall, to step on the Vitalis orb
• Prioritize killing all spawned Vitalii
• After blocking the orb go back to your spot 1-2 steps away from MD and by the south wall

.Green Bomb
> __**Green Bomb**__

$green Green Bomb reference: #green-bomb

__Phase 3:__

• Ultimate on dropdown away from everyone else, but in range to not get Bombs $blue
• Tank all Green Bombs $green targeting you by eating above `10,000` HP or use the Powerburst of Vitality
• Do not accidentally bounce the Green Bomb $green on anyone
 
__Phase 4:__

• If a Green Bomb is on you, step away from any team members and tank the `10,000`
• You can call if the Bomb $green is on you, so the Bomb Tank can Intercept $cept you to negate the damage from it
 
__Phase 5:__

• Position yourself South as usual, with the difference that whoever gets the Green $green must run North, tank it and then go back South
• Tank the Green Bomb $green if it’s on you
• The Bomb Tank should be Intercepting $cept whoever gets it, but you should have enough hp (`10,000`) in case this does not happen

.Team Split
> __**Team Split**__

$ts Team Split reference: #team-split
 
__General Overview:__

• Step into your respective color for each Team Split and go back to your position as soon as possible to avoid dragging Bombs
• This applies to Phases 3 to 5
• Make sure you have at least `8,000` HP if you plan on tanking a Team Split

__Phase 3:__

• If you are using an ultimate on dropdown, make sure you place it close to Vorago and Surge $surge or Bladed Dive $bd to it after Team Split ends
• Reprisal $reprisal can be used to tank the typeless hit of the Team Split
• You can not Reprisal the first Team Split of Phases 3 and 5 if you do not TC (reference: #target-cycle)
 
__Phase 5:__

• Reprisal $reprisal can be used if you use Target Cycle before the first Team Split spawns (reference: #target-cycle) 
• Position in the South-East (not MD) and Ultimate before Vorago spawns if you are target cycling or right after spawn if not

.The End

> __**The End**__

$purple The End reference: #the-end

__Phase 3:__

• Follow Vorago's arms rotating counterclockwise
• Glitch out of Vorago's arms (reference: #the-end) whenever it is possible and Ultimate during the 3rd quadrant
• If you do not glitch out, make sure you pray Mage $deflectmagic and stay in melee distance so you do not get extra damage from the Bombs that are being tagged (usually Blues $blue in trio)

__Phase 4:__

• Follow Vorago's arms rotating counterclockwise
• Stay distanced to the person tagging the Red Bombs $red
 
__Phase 5:__

• Position in the north-east 1 tile away from melee distance
• You can Onslaught $onslaught on dropdown
• If the team is able to push on dropdown, you can Onslaught in MD instead
• Melee Base Tank will go south-east (non-melee Base Tanks usually go north and TL5 south instead)
