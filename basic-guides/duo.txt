.Introduction
> __**Duo Normal Mode**__

This guide focuses on **duo** Normal Mode Vorago only. If you are interested in the basic mechanics that Vorago features, check out the #overview channel. The guide is split into two roles: Base Tank and Bomb Tank. Every section provides step-by-step instructions for both roles.

.Phase 1
> __**Phase 1**__

__Base Tank:__

.

• Stay close to the northern wall, **not too far to the east** - If standing too far to the east, you will receive a lot of Blue Bombs $blue
• Standing on these spots accordingly ensures that the Base Tank does not receive any Blue Bombs:
    - Green circle if tagging without Target Cycle
    - White circle if using TC $tc (reference: #target-cycle)
• As your Bomb Tank reaches the final platform, you will sometimes have to take Vorago a couple of steps east, so it is not too far west off the jump spot
• Once Vorago is in jump spot and low HP, provoke $voke from the south in melee distance to Vorago
• As your Bomb Tank jumps, Escape $escape south and **take 1 step back to the north** (do not take that step if you escaped with dual-wield range weapons)

South voking and the explained positioning can be simplified by learning the advanced strategy of solo luring: #solo-lure

.
__Bomb Tank:__
	
In duo, the responsibilities of the TL5 are merged into the Bomb Tank role. The Bomb Tank has to climb and perform the Top Lure in phase 1.
Climbing reference: #climbing 

• Activate Excalibur $excal
• Eat to 8,000 HP
• Start your climb immediately by spam clicking the entry rock
• You will receive Blue Bombs $blue and Red Bombs $red during your climb, so make sure you are eating enough to not die
• The general idea is: **The faster you are, the less damage you take** - Try to optimize the usage of Surge $surge and Bladed Dive $bd as explained in #climbing 
• Once you have reached the final platform, position yourself at the correct lure spot and provoke $voke Vorago
• Try to **keep Vorago voked on you for the entirety of phase 1** to reduce the amount of Auto Attacks you receive
• Jump once Vorago has low HP
• You require one free inventory space to acquire the ancient maul piece (a) $maulpiecea (reference: #maul)

.Phase 2
> __**Phase 2**__

__Base Tank:__

• Position south of the L-Rock, to make Vorago move into phase 2 center automatically as the first Bleed $bleed is applied (reference: #recenter)
• Freedom $freedom the first Bleed (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Escape $escape the second Bleed 
• Resonance $resonance the Blue Bomb $blue that is fired as the third Bleed is applied on your Bomb Tank
• Get back into melee distance and voke $voke Vorago back after the fifth Bleed is applied

The Base Tank should be *cade cepting* the first Red Bomb $red during phase 2 (reference: #cade-cept)

.
__Bomb Tank:__

• Provoke $voke after second Bleed $bleed 
• Vorago will apply another 3 Bleeds onto the Bomb Tank, follow the instructions in #clearing-bleeds

.
__Bring Him Down:__

#mechanics reference: https://discordapp.com/channels/670983760178839572/736325239138418719/749235595401756773

• Each Reflect $link, Gravity Fields $gravity spawn across the arena, which have to be activated / clicked
• Utilize Bladed Dive $bd to catch the second Gravity Field
• As the last Gravity Field is applied, spam click Vorago to continue the mechanic **Bring Him Down**
• To pass the damage check, do as much damage as you can with Thresholds and Basics
• The second maul piece (b) $maulpieceb will appear on the ground after passing BHD (reference: #maul)
• Kill Vorago and welcome to phase 3!

.Weekly specials
> __**Weekly Specials**__

Every Wednesday at 00:00 GT (in-game reset), the weekly special rotation changes for Vorago. There is a total of 6 rotations: Ceilings $ceil, Scopulus $scop, Vitalis $vitalis, Green Bomb $green, Team Split $ts and The End $purple. Each of these rotations will affect the mechanics in phases 3, 4 and 5.

.Ceilings
> __**Ceilings**__

$ceil Mechanic breakdown: #ceilings 

__Phase 3:__

This phase is FFA-Bomb Tank. Depending on where Vorago jumps to, you will be separated from your partner and anyone can receive blue bombs.
For this reason, whoever is the furthest from Vorago will be the Bomb Tank. To define this distance, both players should try to reach their ultimates, and whoever is far will take bombs

• Bomb Tank Provoke $voke the whole phase
• Vorago jumps after second Auto Attack
• At Reflect $link Bomb Tank can use Resonance or Devotion
• At Red Bomb $red launch Base Tank *devo cept*

Other than that, avoid getting hit by the rocks $ceil.

.
__Phase 4:__

Maul pieces $maul can be stuck beneath dropped rocks $ceil. To retrieve the Maul pieces, you have to destroy them.

• Base Tank Provoke $voke the whole phase
• Bomb Tank Resonance $resonance the first or second Blue Bomb $blue after each Waterfall $waterfall 
• Bomb Tank Devotion $devo the first Blue Bomb after each Stone Clone $vitalis 
• At the Ceilings $ceil special attack Bomb Tank *cade cept* $cade $cept (reference: #cade-cept)
• Both players clear as many rocks as possible (right click => "destroy")
• Clear Bleeds $bleed (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Off for Reflect $link

.
__Phase 5:__

Ceilings $ceil phase 5 shares the same mechanic and strategies with #team-split $ts

.

__Phase 3:__

Ice Nihils $nihilice will cause Scopuli $scop to randomly change their target! Avoid using them.

• Scopuli target those closest to them
• Scopuli target those dealing the most damage to them
• Bomb Tank positions in the very South-West corner and Ultimate $sunshine $swiftness 
• Base Tank positions at the marked green cross $greencross and Ultimate
• Base Tank tags the western Scopulus first and then the eastern to make sure both attack them
• If maging the Base Tank can tag the eastern Scopulus with a Dragon Breath $dbreath to easily lure them immediately. Combined with Target Cycle this becomes even more powerful (reference: #target-cycle)
• Both players Devotion $devo once the first Scopulus $scop is about to die
• Whenever a Scopulus starts walking towards the Bomb Tank, the Base Tank has to Provoke $voke immediately

__Phase4:__

As the "special attack", Vorago will instead launch a Red Bomb $red in phase 4.

• Bomb Tank Resonance $resonance the first or second Blue Bomb $blue after each Waterfall $waterfall 
• Bomb Tank Devotion $devo the first Blue Bomb after each Stone Clone $vitalis

• Clear Bleeds $bleed (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Off for Reflect $link

__Phase 5:__

Scopulus $scop phase 5 shares the same mechanic and strategies with #the-end $purple
