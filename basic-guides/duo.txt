> __**Duo Normal Mode**__

This guide focusses on **duo** Normal Mode Vorago only. If you are looking for other team sizes, Hard Mode or advanced guides refer back to the #ðŸ“Œguide-index index channel. If you are interested in the basic mechanics that Vorago features, check out the #mechanics channel. The guide is split into two roles: Base Tank and Bomb Tank. Every section provides step-by-step instructions for both roles.

> __**Phase 1**__

__Base Tank:__

Arena reference: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676485011268042761/749740415917359114/area_v1.png

_ _
â€¢ Stay close to the northern wall, **not too far to the east** - If standing too far to the east, you will receive a lot of Blue Bombs $blue
â€¢ Standing on these spots accordingly ensures that the Base Tank does not receive any Blue Bombs:
    - Green circle if tagging without Target Cycle
    - White circle if using TC $tc (reference: #target-cycle)
â€¢ As your Bomb Tank reaches the final platform, you will sometimes have to take Vorago a couple of steps east, so it is not too far west off the jump spot
â€¢ Once Vorago is in jump spot and low HP, provoke $voke from the south in melee distance to Vorago
â€¢ As your Bomb Tank jumps, Escape :Escape: south and **take 1 step back to the north** (do not take that step if you escaped with dual-wield range weapons)

South voking and the explained positioning can be simplified by learning the advanced strategy of solo luring: #solo-lure

_ _
__Bomb Tank:__

In duo, the responsibilities of the TL5 are merged into the Bomb Tank role. The Bomb Tank has to climb and perform the Top Lure in phase 1.

Climbing reference: #climbing 

â€¢ Activate Excalibur $excal
â€¢ Eat to 8,000 HP
â€¢ Start your climb immediately by spam clicking the entry rock
â€¢ You will receive Blue Bombs $blue and Red Bombs $red during your climb, so make sure you are eating enough to not die
â€¢ The general idea is: **The faster you are, the less damage you take** - Try to optimize the usage of Surge $surge and Bladed Dive $bd as explained in #climbing 
â€¢ Once you have reached the final platform, position yourself at the correct lure spot and provoke $voke Vorago
â€¢ Try to **keep Vorago voked on you for the entirety of phase 1** to reduce the amount of Auto Attacks you receive
â€¢ Jump once Vorago has low HP
â€¢ You require one free inventory space to acquire the ancient maul piece (a) $maulpiecea (reference: #maul)

_ _

> __**Phase 2**__

Reflect $link reference: https://discordapp.com/channels/670983760178839572/736325239138418719/749235485754261544

__Base Tank:__

â€¢ Position south of the L-Rock, to make Vorago move into phase 2 center automatically as the first Bleed $bleed: is applied (reference: #recenter)
â€¢ Freedom :Freedom: the first Bleed (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
â€¢ Escape :Escape: the second Bleed 
â€¢ Resonance :Resonance: the Blue Bomb $blue that is fired as the third Bleed is applied on your Bomb Tank
â€¢ Get back into melee distance and voke $voke Vorago back after the fifth Bleed is applied

The Base Tank should be *cade cepting* the first and third Red Bomb $red during phase 2 (reference: #cade-cept)

_ _
__Bomb Tank:__

â€¢ Provoke $voke after second Bleed $bleed: 
â€¢ Vorago will apply another 3 Bleeds onto the Bomb Tank, follow the instructions in #clearing-bleeds

The Bomb Tank should be *cade cepting* the second Red Bomb $red during phase 2 (reference: #cade-cept)

_ _
__Bring Him Down:__

#mechanics reference: https://discordapp.com/channels/670983760178839572/736325239138418719/749235595401756773

â€¢ Each Reflect $link, Gravity Fields :gravityorb: spawn across the arena, which have to be activated / clicked
â€¢ Utilize Bladed Dive $bd to catch the fourth Gravity Field
â€¢ As the last Gravity Field is applied, spam click Vorago to continue the mechanic **Bring Him Down**
â€¢ To pass the damage check, do as much damage as you can with Thresholds and Basics
â€¢ The second maul piece (b) :maulpieceb: will appear on the ground after passing BHD (reference: #maul)
â€¢ Kill Vorago and welcome to phase 3!

_ _

> __**Weekly rotations**__

Every Wednesday at 00:00 GT (in-game reset), the weekly special rotation changes for Vorago.
