> __**Phase Overview**__

This channel provides a general overview for all mechanics occurring throughout a full kill at Vorago.

• $maulpiecea Phase 1 - Vorago has to be jumped on to progress to phase 2
• $gravity Phase 2 - Time-gated phase; Vorago has to be destabilized to progress to phase 3
• $ts Phase 3 - Weekly changing mechanics start in this phase
• $waterfall Phase 4 - Time-gated phase; Vorago implodes thrice before you can progress to phase 5
• $maul Phase 5 - Out-last Vorago's damage by dealing more damage to him

 The phase breakdown of Hard Mode can be found in the last section.

> __**Phase 1**__

$red Red Bomb ➔ $auto 4 auto attacks ➔ $repeat Repeat

Vorago does not leave the spawn location until a player climbs past the entry obstacle in the west (reference: #climbing). At this point Vorago will follow whoever vokes :Provoke: to hold his aggression. Vorago repeats a basic attack pattern of a Red Bomb $red followed by 4 auto attacks, Blue Bombs $blue or melee Swipes $swipe, until the phase is finished (reference: #mechanics).

As described in #climbing, Vorago needs to be jumped on from the Top Lure / final platform of the climb. During the jump animation Vorago has a chance of switching his aggression to a random player. The attack pattern continues steadily.

After the jump Vorago's HP can be lowered to 0 and you will progress to phase 2.

.p2
> __**Phase 2**__

$bleed 5 Bleeds ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $link Reflect ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $red Red Bomb ➔ $auto 4 auto attacks ➔ $repeat Repeat

At the start of every Reflect a Gravity Field $gravity spawns (abbreviation: "Orb"). 4 orbs have to be activated (left-clicked) in order to progress to the Bring Him Down mechanic. After passing the damage check Vorago can be killed and you continue to Phase 3.

• $bleed Bleeds
• $link Reflect
• $red Red Bomb
• $gravity Gravity Fields and Bring Him Down

Check #mechanics for additional information.

> __**Rotations**__

Every reset after Tuesday the weekly special rotation changes for Vorago. This change applies to both Modes.

Each of these rotations will affect the mechanics in **Phases 3 to 5** Normal Mode and **Phases 9 to 11** in Hard Mode.
There’s a total of **6 rotations** or **Weekly Specials**.

.
__Normal Mode:__

• $ceil Celing Collapse #ceilings
• $scop Scopulus #scopulus
• $vitalis Vitalis #vitalis
• $green Green Bomb #green-bomb
• $ts Team Split #team-split
• $purple The End #the-end

.
__Hard Mode:__

Phase 1 and 2 are similar to Normal Mode. In Phase 1, every Blue Bomb $blue has a chance of dragging the TL5 back into the arena and the climb has to be restarted. For Phase 2 the duration of BHD is reduced from **12 seconds** to **7.8 seconds**.
Phases 3 to 8 feature weekly specials, following the same attack pattern as Normal Mode on each respective Phase 3, with all differences listed in each channel.
Phases 9, 10 and 11 change according to the current week's special rotation.

The Phase order for Hard Mode is as follows:
• $maulpiecea Phase 1 ➔ $gravity Phase 2 ➔ $ceil Ceilings Phase 3 ➔ $scop Scopulus Phase 4 ➔ $vitalis Vitalis Phase 5 ➔ $green Green Bomb Phase 6 ➔ $ts Team Split Phase 7 ➔ $purple Purple Bomb Phase 8 ➔ Phase 9 ➔ $dome Phase 10 ➔ $maul Phase 11
