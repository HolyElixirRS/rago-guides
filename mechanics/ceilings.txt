> __**Ceilings**__

At the weekly special Ceilings $ceil Vorago collapses one of the 9 square grids in the arena, dropping a blocking rock onto the selected area.

• A shadow indicates the location of the rock before it drops down
• Players located beneath the rock in a 3 tile radius (area of 7x7 tiles) take typeless damage
• Vorago jumps to the sky and lands in a random section that is not blocked by a rock
• Players located beneath a rock or Vorago's jump destination $vorago will be pushed away (it is possible to be stuck under a rock - Get free by destroying it)
• Rocks can be destroyed by right-clicking them, dealing typeless damage to the player
• Maul pieces $maul can be stuck beneath dropped rocks, destroy the rocks to retrieve them

__Shadows:__

• The shadow indicating the location of a rock fall destination is not always visible
• Your graphics settings must be set to **medium** for shadows
• Additionally, specific sky boxes cause shadows to disappear
