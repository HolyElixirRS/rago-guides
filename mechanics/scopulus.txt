> __**Scopulus**__

At the weekly special Scopulus $scop Vorago summons multiple Scopulii, dealing rapid melee damage $deflectmelee to players surrounding them.

• Scopulii have `150,000` life points
• Rarely, their aggression changes randomly (Ice Nihils $nihilice and Ripper Demons $ripper always cause Scopulii to change aggression)
• Scopulus target the player standing closest to their spawn or the player attacking first
• Their defence is significantly lowered towards magic attacks $magic
• When one Scopulus $scop dies, all remaining Scopulii become stronger and heal by `15,000` life points

Phases 4 and 5 do **not** feature the Scopulus mechanic and make use of other standard mechanics instead.

__Broken Flanking:__

Scopulii can be flanked $flank by the person holding their aggression. The flanking angle of a Scopulus breaks upon a diagonal square moved within a flanking angle / diagonal compass direction, due to their size being 2 x 2 tiles. The flanking angle updates and gets fixed once the angle is turned for more than 90°.
