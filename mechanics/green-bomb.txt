> **__Green Bomb__**

At the weekly special Green Bomb $green Vorago launches a bomb, dealing `10,000` damage to its last primary target.

• The Green Bomb is first launched to one of the 9 square grids in the arena
• Once the Green Bomb bounces on the ground, it leaves a **mist**
• Staying in the green mist will drain your life points, prayer points and run energy, increasing progressively
• A player target is selected randomly and a message box appears: "Vorago has sent a green bomb after you."
• On explosion, `10,000` damage is dealt to the primary target, cancelling all defensive abilities and draining **10%** adrenaline
• Taking the `10,000` damage results in Vorago $vorago going into a Reflect $link immediately

A confirmed bug exists that a player signing to the `10,000` typeless damage causes Vorago to immediately send out another Green Bomb $green.

__Bridging:__

• A Green Bomb can be bridged by staying next to another player
• The Green Bomb $green will then deal minor damage to both players and bounce onto the other player in a 2 tile radius
• Upon bridging all defensive abilities are cancelled and 10% adrenaline is drained
• The Green Bomb disappears after having bounced 5 times in phase 3 (in P5 NM, P10 and P11 HM it requires to be bridged 4 times)
• If the Green Bomb hits the same target multiple times, they take additional damage
